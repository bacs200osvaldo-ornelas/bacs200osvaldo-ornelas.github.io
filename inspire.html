        		Everyone has their own favorite hero that they take inspiration from. This can be a fictional character in a movie who saves others with their superpowers, or it can even be a real human being. It is their values and actions that shape them as a hero.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		The following characteristics below are what I believe shapes a hero.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Motivation - They motivate others to follow their dreams, no matter how impossible it may seem</li>
        		<li>Determination - They never give up regardless of their situation</li>
        		<li>Entrepreneurial - They show confidence to continue their goals even if they initially fail </li>
        		<li>Humility - Even though someone may become very good at something, they know they are not better than others and still put respect </li>
        		
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        	Personally, Michael Oher is a great example of all of these characteristics, making him one of the top people I look up to. He was a hero for himself. Coming from a rough childhood, to becoming very successful. Even though it seemed impossible for him to succeed in his early life, he never gave up and ultimately it paid off.
